//! Canonical tool catalogue — the single source of truth for what exists and
//! what can actually run.
//!
//! # Architectural invariant
//!
//! ```text
//!     catalogue definition  !=  executable capability
//! ```
//!
//! A [`ToolDefinition`](crate::enhanced_bridge::ToolDefinition) is a *claim*. An
//! executable capability requires all of:
//!
//! ```text
//!     definition
//!   + valid parameter schema
//!   + real executor
//!   + permission / risk policy
//!   + deterministic dispatch binding      (the tool id constrains the operation)
//!   + reachable named product path        (required for R3)
//!   + captured execution evidence         (required for R3)
//! ```
//!
//! # Why there is no single "tool count"
//!
//! Quantity is not a correctness invariant. A catalogue of 150 names attached to
//! a simulator is worth less than twelve tools that actually execute. This module
//! therefore exposes five explicit, separately-scoped metrics and deliberately
//! offers no aggregate "tool count" for anything to assert on:
//!
//! | metric | counts |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`CatalogueMetrics::definition_count`] | every catalogued definition |
//! | [`CatalogueMetrics::executable_count`] | definitions with a real executor |
//! | [`CatalogueMetrics::tested_execution_count`] | executable **and** exercised by a committed test |
//! | [`CatalogueMetrics::product_reachable_count`] | executable **and** reachable from a product surface |
//! | [`CatalogueMetrics::r3_verified_count`] | exercised through a product surface with captured evidence |
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Derived from `docs/governance/TOOL_CATALOGUE_TRUTH_TABLE.md`. The bridge is
//! 0 REAL / 27 SIMULATED / 27 UNREACHABLE; `real_tools` provides 20 real
//! executors — 12 general-purpose plus the 8 read-only repository-intelligence
//! (`nav.*`) tools. The historical `>= 100` / `>= 150` / `>= 25` assertions were
//! calibrated to a tool surface that was never committed and are not product
//! requirements.
