//! Live provider commissioning probe (Master Execution Baseline §11).
//!
//! Ignored by default so the normal battery never touches the network. Run
//! explicitly with:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test -p zylcode-core --test live_commissioning -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Classification this test establishes (never collapsed into "provider
//! works"): `configured` → `authenticated` → `request sent` →
//! `HTTP response received` → `completion received`. It does NOT establish
//! streaming (the router chunks completed responses post-hoc), provider-native
//! tool calling, or multimodality.
//!
//! Invariants asserted here (the test FAILS only when the result would be a
//! lie):
//! * a persisted cache/vector-cache/synthetic payload must never be reported
//!   as a provider response;
//! * an answer faster than any real round-trip is rejected;
//! * an external condition (e.g. account balance) yields an honest BLOCKED
//!   classification, not a failure.
//!
//! Secrets: API keys are read by the router from the environment through the
//! application's intended path and are never printed, logged, or asserted on.
