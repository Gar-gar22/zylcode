# ZYLCODE MASTER BASELINE — 2026-09-28

**Authority:** ZYLCODE FORENSIC RESUME + MASTER EXECUTION BASELINE (28 Sep 2026).
**Method:** every row was verified against **source or an executed command in this
working tree on 2026-09-28**, never against historical claims. Evidence codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **[S]** | verified by source inspection (path cited) |
| **[T]** | verified by a test that executed in this session's battery |
| **[R]** | **RUNTIME verified on 2026-09-28** (real process/network/UI) |
| **[D]** | documentation only — no runtime or test evidence this session |

Status vocabulary (no other words are used):
`IMPLEMENTED` · `TESTED` · `UI_WIRED` · `RUNTIME_VERIFIED` · `EVIDENCE_RECORDED` ·
`ACCEPTED` · `BLOCKED` · `UNVERIFIED` · `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

A row can carry several states; they are not collapsed. "Mostly done" and
"production ready" appear nowhere in this document.

## 1. Capability map

### 1.1 Shell and workspace surfaces

| Subsystem | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|

| — Tauri IPC project commands (`create/open/list/read/write/list_directory/git_status/close`) | **NOT_IMPLEMENTED (as reachable surface)** — file exists but is an orphan: never `mod`-declared, never compiled, never registered | [S] `src-tauri/src/commands/project.rs` + zero `mod commands` in `main.rs` → gap register G-02 |
| Repository loading | IMPLEMENTED · RUNTIME_VERIFIED | [R] `serve-intel` indexed `C:\Projects\zylcode`, Explorer shows 447 files |

| File **write** through HTTP | NOT_IMPLEMENTED (by design today) | [S] no write route in `serve-intel` router — noted, not a defect claim |
| File **write** through editor UI | **NOT_IMPLEMENTED** (backend command missing) | [S] `useArtifactStream.saveFile` → `safeInvoke("save_workspace_artifact")` not in `generate_handler` → G-03 |

### 1.2 Agent, missions, planning, tools

| Subsystem | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|

| Planner — model-authored plan | BLOCKED · UNVERIFIED | requires live completion; no evidence produced |

| Tool-operation binding (executor cannot exceed its bound operation) | IMPLEMENTED · TESTED | [S][T] binding enforcement + `bridge_git_commit_cannot_execute_push` |
| Simulated success removal (Gate-0 invariant) | IMPLEMENTED · TESTED | [S] `tool.rs` `unsupported_mock` exists only in comments explaining its removal; catalogue metrics pinned (`r3_verified_count == 0` asserted) |

| Lint execution | IMPLEMENTED (through shell/cargo) · UI_WIRED (none) | [S] no dedicated lint tool id; `cargo clippy` runs in battery and CI workflow |
| Git inspection | IMPLEMENTED · TESTED · UI_WIRED · RUNTIME_VERIFIED | [S] `git.status`/`git.diff` executors, `/api/git/status` [S] SourceControlPanel diffstat [R] git log/status run constantly this session |

| Approval system (capability gate, default-deny) | IMPLEMENTED · TESTED | [S] `mcp/permission.rs` default `allow_up_to: Some(Read)` [T] `decision_proptest.rs` property tests (deny overrides allow, invalid session always denies) |
| Approval surfaced in GUI mission flow | UI_WIRED · UNVERIFIED | [S] MissionComposer autonomy selector exists; no evidence it gates `run-next` execution |
| Actor identity | IMPLEMENTED · TESTED | [S] `mcp/actor.rs` task-local actor; every `ToolEvidence` row carries actor [T] evidence tests |

### 1.3 Providers, context, memory, sessions

| Live LLM execution — completion received | **BLOCKED** | DeepSeek `402 Insufficient Balance`; Anthropic `401 API key is invalid`; OpenRouter key not in `sk-or-…` format → 401. No completion from any provider. |
| Provider commissioning test (`commissioning_test.rs`) | TESTED but **vacuous** — returns Ok without Ollama; green ≠ commissioning | [S] early `return Ok(())` on router failure → G-05 |

| Memory — project facts / derived repository intelligence | IMPLEMENTED · TESTED | [S] `intelligence/persisted.rs` content-hash freshness (stale intelligence invalidated deterministically) |
| Memory — chat history, user preferences, architectural decisions as distinct stores | UNVERIFIED (settings exist: IMPLEMENTED · TESTED · UI_WIRED via `settings.test.ts`) | [S] no dedicated decision/preference memory module found beyond settings + claims |
| Memory must not override current repository evidence | IMPLEMENTED (for intel: content-hash invalidation) · UNVERIFIED (cross-cutting rule) | [S] persisted.rs design [D] no global memory-authority test |

### 1.6 Platform (Wave F and cross-cutting)

| Subsystem | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Security — workspace path boundaries | IMPLEMENTED · TESTED | [S] `project/filesystem.rs` canonicalize + `starts_with(root)` + `..` rejection [T] 10 tests |
| Security — shell argument-injection defense | IMPLEMENTED · TESTED | [S] `real_tools.rs` metacharacter handling (documented `shell.execute` as the explicit escape hatch) |
| Security — symlink traversal | UNVERIFIED | no explicit symlink check found; canonicalize mitigates partially |
| Security — approval gates | IMPLEMENTED · TESTED | §Approval row |
| Security — secret handling | IMPLEMENTED · TESTED (by inspection this session) | env-only key resolution, never printed; this session's probes printed presence/length only |
| Security — MCP trust boundary | IMPLEMENTED · TESTED | fail-closed bridge tests (`unknown tool id fails closed`, definitions metadata-only) |
| Security — prompt-injection boundary (repo content instructing the agent) | NOT_IMPLEMENTED / UNVERIFIED | no boundary module found — real gap |

| Installed-runtime verification (built app running as an installed artifact) | UNVERIFIED | no installed build exercised this session; historical `INSTALLATION_SUCCESS.md` is [D] only |

---

## 2. Historical checkpoints — verdicts (§3 of the mandate)

| Lead | Verdict today |
|---|---|
| Gate-0 remediation integrated into main | **CONFIRMED** [S] — `permission.rs`, `evidence.rs`, `actor.rs`, `tool_catalogue.rs` present; tests enforce the invariants |
| Executor + binding enforcement exist | **CONFIRMED** [S][T] |
| Simulated success removed from critical paths | **CONFIRMED** [S][T] — `unsupported_mock` only in explanatory comments; catalogue pinned `r3 == 0` |
| Actor/evidence mechanisms exist | **CONFIRMED** [S][T] |
| Design system established | **CONFIRMED** [S][R] |
| Eight themes | **CONFIRMED** [S][R] — all 8 listed in the live picker |
| Shell major working zones | **CONFIRMED** [S][R] |
| Agent Dock + Bottom Panel | **CONFIRMED** [S][R] |
| UX-01C dirty/uncommitted | **RESOLVED** — committed (`e766f5a` secure local project workspace backend; `cc38b73` clippy-clean project filesystem). Only `filesystem.rs.backup` remains untracked. |
| Secure local project workspace backend | **CONFIRMED in core** [S][T] (10 tests) — but its **Tauri IPC layer is an orphan** (G-02) |
| Live provider commissioning not conclusively proven | **STILL TRUE, now with evidence** — real egress, no completion (BLOCKED: balance/invalid keys) |
| Remote CI affected by billing | **STILL BLOCKED** (external; local battery is the authority) |
| Repository intelligence a major next phase | **PARTLY REALIZED** — 15 modules, 46 tests, live index; remaining: progressive indexing UNVERIFIED, provenance of model context UNVERIFIED |

---

## 3. What this baseline does NOT establish

- No live model completion → every "the model did X" capability stays BLOCKED/UNVERIFIED.
- No installed-app run, no remote CI run, no true streaming, no multimodal probe.
- The GUI core-loop proof is limited to what §7 of the Execution Report states; anything not cited there was not observed.
